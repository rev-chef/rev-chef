<h1>Hi there, I'm Noah 👋</h1>
I'm a Software Development student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), currently in my 1st year. I LOVE reverse-engineering malware and video games (particularly on the Nintendo DS), I am also passionate about learning new programming / scripting skills, participating in every CTF I'm allowed in, and coming up with ways to break (digital) things (legally).
